**BigBrother** is a small admin utility plugin for Minecraft servers, offering surveillance features that allow
administrators to monitor and track user interactions with various game objects and actions. From anvils to private
messages, BigBrother keeps admins informed in real time.

## Features

BigBrother sends notifications to admins whenever a user performs specific actions, including:

- **AnvilSpy**: Notifies when a user interacts with an anvil, displaying the item's name before and after the
  interaction.
- **BookSpy**: Notifies when a user writes in a Book and Quill.
- **CommandSpy**: Notifies when any command is executed by a player.
- **PortalSpy**: Notifies when a player travels through a teleport portal (e.g., Nether or End).
- **SignSpy**: Notifies when a player interacts with a sign.
- **SocialSpy**: Notifies when a player sends a private message.

These notifications provide insight into player activities, helping maintain server integrity.

## Commands

The primary command for the **BigBrother** plugin is `/bigbrother`. Use the following subcommands to manage different
functionalities:

| Command           | Description                   |
